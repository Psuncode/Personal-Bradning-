Every developer eventually starts a blog. Mine has been a long time coming.

## Why Write?

Writing forces a kind of clarity that thinking alone never does. I can hold a half-formed idea in my head for weeks, convinced I understand it — and then the moment I try to write it down, I discover how many gaps there are.

I've built enough things now that I have a backlog of lessons worth sharing: patterns that worked, mistakes I made twice before learning them, and insights about the intersection of software, product, and business that I haven't seen articulated the way I'd want to read them.

## Who This Is For

Honestly, mostly me. Writing is how I process and solidify what I know. But if you're a developer interested in building real things — not just toy projects — or a student trying to figure out how software and business fit together, you'll probably find something useful here.

## What I'll Cover

A few themes I'll return to:

- **Building real software** — lessons from projects that shipped and ones that didn't
- **TypeScript patterns** — the things I reach for on every project
- **Product thinking** — how to build things people actually want
- **Career reflections** — what it's like to be a CS student who's also interested in startups, investing, and business

I won't post on a fixed schedule. I'll write when I have something worth saying.
